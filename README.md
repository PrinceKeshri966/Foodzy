# Campus Meal Pre-booking System

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort by **Prince Keshri** and **Tanushri Goel**. We have developed an innovative solution to enhance the dining experience for students on our campus. Our system allows students to pre-book their meals from any store within the campus, saving them valuable time.

## Features
- **Pre-booking**: Book your meals in advance from anywhere on the campus.
- **Multiple Stores**: Choose from a variety of stores available on the campus.
- **Time Saving**: No more waiting in long queues for your meal.

## How It Works
1. **Log in** to your account.
2. **Select** your preferred store.
3. **Choose** your meal.
4. **Pre-book** at your convenient time.
5. **Pick up** your meal at the scheduled time.

## Future Scope
We aim to continually improve and expand this system based on user feedback and needs. Stay tuned for more exciting features!
